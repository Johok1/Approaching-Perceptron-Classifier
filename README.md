# Approaching Perceptron classifier
 In this project I am attempting to develop a methodology for implementing machine learning models in embedded environments. This project uses a perceptron model and two input sensors (PIR and ultrasonic) in order to determine whether or not a person will reach the system within 10 seconds. The ultrasonic is used to gain change in acceleration data, and the PIR returns 1 if there is movement and -1 if there is none. The first goal of this is to show how a model can be trained in an embedded environment without using a cloud or an external database. The methodology behind this is the real-time acquisition, utilization, and expulsion of training data. The second goal is to determine whether or not the system can learn to utilize the two sensors to compensate for each others faults.
